## Notes

- briefly discussed the principles and priorities with no immediate concern

## Resolutions

1.  The meeting amended the draft rules to:
    1.  Remove this clause from s. 5(a)ii: "except as an owner-occupier of residential property or through shares in an index or superannuation fund",
    2.  Reduce the size of the management committee from seven to five, and
    3.  Change the quorum of the management committee from three to a simple majority.
2.  The meeting endorsed the rules as amended.
3.  The meeting clarified that the definition of "executive management" for the purpose of s. 5 and s. 12 applies to "C-suite or equivalent" rather than operational management.
4.  The meeting clarified that the definition of "significant financial interests" for the purpose of s. 5 would be defined in bylaws to avoid inadvertently excluding members who might incidentally own two properties.
5.  The meeting applied s. 5(b) to permit Kurt Labuschewski to allow them to continue being an active organiser with Greater Brisbane despite their employment by their family's building company.
6.  The meeting unanimously appointed Travis Jordan, Kurt Labuschewski, Rob Lucas, April Broadbent and Alexander Jago to the management committee.
7.  The meeting endorsed affiliating with the Abundant Housing Network Australia and the Parking Reform Network.
